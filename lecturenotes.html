    <h2>Page 1: Fundamentals of Self-Hypnosis</h2>
    <p>Self-hypnosis is a tool for accessing the deeper layers of the mind, where core programs dictate behavior and health. By inducing relaxed states, one can rewrite these internal scripts, fostering harmony between thoughts and biology.</p>
    <p>We all have habits, an habit is when you are used to doing something a particular type of way that without thinking, you can do it over and over again. All habits are created this way. Since we are talking about Habits, we need to know two entities come into play here,and this is very fundamental in the work that we do in Ebleco.We all have habits. An habit is when you have repeated a behaviour or an action many times that now, it has become an automatic process for you to repeat the same behaviour. As Humans, we end up with habits because that's primarily how and why it is easy for us to live our lives the way we do.If there were no habits, we would literally have to think about every single thing we do everyday of our lives and that would be completely tiring and difficult for eveeyone. So life has been designed for us to live with habits,now herein lies the twist, These habits we end up with later in life are all recorded without our conscious awareness,they are literally like tapes that have content recorded in them,and its whatever that has been recorded in them that we hear playing. This means when we picked up these habits, we were not aware we picked them up.Now, the question is where do these habits come from, how did we get them?, who gave us?.</p>
   <p>Well, during the first six to seven years of our lives as babies and children, we were functioning primarily most in a lower brain vibration, we had much of theta brainwave activity going on in our brains<strong>,(this content is unavailable until users sign up for Ebleco community features)</strong> that's why as adults, ws see kids ride a broom and says its a horse,its an interesting thing to know that all kids function primarily in <strong>(this content is unavailable until you sign up for the ebleco community)</strong></p> We have two types of mind, the conscious and the subconscious mind.Habits are created not with the conscious mimd but with the subconscious mind.</p>

    <h2> Understanding Habits and the Mind</h2>
    <p>For every experience we have had, whether we remember it or not, our brains keep these experiences stored as subconscious memories. These memories influence our thoughts, behaviors, and responses.</p>
    <p>Humans have two minds: the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. The conscious mind is the seat of goals, ambitions, and desires and controls approximately 5% of our day-to-day activities. The subconscious mind governs the majority of our habits and automatic behaviors.</p>
    <p>Habits form when we repeat certain actions until they become automatic. It is not the conscious mind that creates habits, but the subconscious mind. Understanding this is key to mastering self-change and inner programming.</p>
